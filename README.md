Repository for Khan Academy lesson 6 project, Shooting Star

To members of DSC Intermediate.

Once you do the project on Shooting Star, fork this repository and push your own code. After that, create a pull requuest, clearly detailing the changes you made to your work. 

Please make your work as unique and creative as possible. You can use some help from your fellow peers if you get stuck on a part of the project.

Create a seperate branch for each iteration of your work.

After you submit, I will create a seperate branch for every member's code, and then we shall review the code together the next time we meet. Before then, I will have commented on everyone's code with any changes or improvements they need to make.

Thank you and hope to see your work soon.
